Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
This EULA (including the Software license, any related orders, and all disputes arising out of or relating thereto) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act are expressly excluded.
Any controversy, claim, or dispute arising out of or relating to this EULA, the Software, or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof (including the determination of the scope or applicability of this arbitration provision) shall be resolved exclusively by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator experienced in technology and software licensing disputes. The seat (legal place) of arbitration shall be Wilmington, Delaware (or such other location as the parties may mutually agree). The language of the arbitration shall be English. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
The parties agree that: (a) The arbitrator shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration provision, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of it is void or voidable; (b) Discovery shall be limited in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules; and (c) The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision explaining the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
The parties agree to arbitrate only on an individual basis and hereby waive any right to bring, participate in, or consolidate any claims as a class action, private attorney general action, or any other representative proceeding. If any court or arbitrator determines that the foregoing class action waiver is unenforceable or invalid for any reason, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety, and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate.

Waiver and Severability
Failure by either party to exercise any of its rights under, or to enforce any provision of, this EULA will not be deemed a waiver or forfeiture of such rights or ability to enforce such provision. If any provision of this EULA is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be amended to achieve as nearly as possible the same economic effect of the original provision and the remainder of this EULA will remain in full force and effect.

Modification
SOC Prime may modify this EULA in its sole discretion from time to time. SOC Prime will provide reasonable prior notice of material modifications (e.g., those that materially reduce functionality, increase fees mid-term, or impose new material obligations on Users) by posting the updated EULA on the Company's publicly available Site and/or notifying Users via email or in-app notification at least thirty (30) days in advance (or such shorter period as may be required for urgent legal or security reasons). Non-material modifications will take effect upon posting. Continued use of the Software after the effective date constitutes User's acceptance of the modified EULA. If a material modification is unacceptable to User, User's sole remedy is to terminate this EULA and cease using the Software, with any prepaid unused fees refunded on a pro-rata basis (unless otherwise prohibited by law). No one other than SOC Prime has the right to modify this EULA.
